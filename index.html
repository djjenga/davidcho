									<p>Rev. David Tae Yong Cho, age 90, passed away on January 13, 2022 in Los Angeles, surrounded by his loving wife, Elizabeth, children, and grandchildren. Rev. Cho was born on Dec 24, 1931 in Ichon in present-day North Korea.
										<p> Rev. Cho was a graduate of Yonsei University (Political Science, B.A.) and Korea University (Business, M.B.A.). He completed a series of graduate degrees in theology en route to his ordainment as a pastor. During his undergraduate studies, Rev. Cho enlisted in the South Korean army as a student volunteer in the Korean War. It was during the Korean War that the 38th parallel was drawn between North and South Korea, forever separating him from his parents and siblings in the North. He received a Korean equivalent of a Purple Heart and a Medal of Freedom for his bravery and personal injuries incurred in the war. His experiences in the war propelled him into a life of politics, journalism, and press freedom.
											<p>He married his college sweetheart, Elizabeth in Seoul on December 5, 1959. In Korea, he served as Editor in Chief of several newspapers and publications, such as Dokseo Press, Samsung Press, and Kookmin Ilbo. He immigrated to the United States in 1975 and started a new life in Oahu, Hawaii. In Hawaii, he led countless non-profit efforts and service initiatives, such as  for the unification of North and South Korea, the advocacy of Korean-American rights and issues in the United States, as well as the Olympic planning committee for the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
												<p>In the early 90s, he began a rigorous series of coursework which culminated in his ordainment as a pastor in 1995. He combined his passion for press/media and his Christian faith by founding and directing the Korean Christian Broadcasting Network in Hawaii as well as serving on leadership positions in the Korean Christian Broadcast Association. He was fiercely proud of his service in the military, and served as director of the Korean War Veterans Association.
													<p>He loved Christmas (his birthday was Christmas Eve), eating cold noodles (naengmyun), and going to the beach.
														<p>Rev. Cho is survived by his wife (Elizabeth), daughter (Mary), sons (John and Paul), son-in-law (Sam), daughter-in-law (Romy and Josephine), and grandchildren (David, Esther, Jayden).
